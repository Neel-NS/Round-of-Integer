Round of Integer Problem Solution
Problem : 
    An integer is round if it is greater than '0'. And the sum of it's digits in decimal representation is a multiple of '10'. 
    Find the N-th smallest round integer. 
 
Input :
    i> The first line of the input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. 
        The dsecription of 'T' test cases follows.
    ii> The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer 'N'.

Output :
    For each test case, print a single line containing the N-th round integer. It is guaranteed that the number is smaller than 2^64.

Constraints :
    1 <= T <= 10^5
    1 <= N <= 10^18

Example Input :
    1
    2

Example Output :
    28

Example Case 1 : 
    The Smallest round integer is '19' and the second smallest is '28'.
